# Discord-Censor-Bot
JanitorBot censors swears, racial slurs, any words you don't want to show up in a Discord. The bot auto-deletes the message containing the banned word and writes a message explaining why the message was deleted.

Simply change 'badword1' 'badword2' to the words you want to be auto-deleted by the bot and extend the list with a comma and more words inside of ''. 

Note that other programmers often choose to hide the bot's token number in a .env file but for convenience and simplicity I chose not to include that here.
